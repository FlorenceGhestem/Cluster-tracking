# Cluster-tracking approach
We propose novel approaches based on cluster-tracking for clustering patients from longitudinal data extracted from medico-
administrative databases. We applied our approaches to the analysis of antithrombotic drug prescriptions extracted from the Echantillon Généraliste des Bénéficiaires (a French cohort) between 2008 and 2018 in patients aged from 60 to 70 years old. From this data, we simulated 5594 patients with their drug prescriptions. This simulated sample is used to applied our cluster-tracking approaches.
